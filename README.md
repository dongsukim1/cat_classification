# Automated Wildlife Camera Trap Classifier

This project is currently a work in progress. The dataset is derived from the LILA BC Caltech Camera Trap dataset originally published in "Recognition in Terra Incognita" for ECCV. The original publication created 
the dataset as a benchmark to test the ability of SOTA Computer Vision models to be able to generalize between locations.
